# Rihla Development Journal

## 2026-03-04 — First session: CLAUDE.md creation

### First impressions

Solid feature-first Flutter app. The architecture is clean — each feature is self-contained with its own models/providers/screens/services pattern. The offline-first approach with SQLite caching + sync queue is well thought out, especially for a travel app where connectivity is unreliable.

The Riverpod usage is manual (no code-gen) which keeps things readable. Every data stream has the same cache-on-success + fallback-to-cache pattern, which is consistent and predictable.

### Observations

- The mixed navigation approach (GoRouter for top-level + Navigator.push for CommandCenter and below) is pragmatic but creates a wall for deep linking. If someone shares a link to a specific expense or gear item, there's no way to route there directly.
- Using `Decimal` instead of `double` for money is the right call. Too many apps get bitten by floating point with currencies.
- OMR with 3 decimal places is hardcoded. The settings model has a `currencyCode` field suggesting multi-currency was planned but never shipped.
- The naming is a bit split — "Rihla" in the repo/README, "Safar" in the package/UI. Both mean "journey/travel" in Arabic.
- 23 Supabase migrations tell a story of iterative development. The RLS fix in migration 023 suggests there was a security gap that got caught and fixed.

### Random thoughts

- The `is_trip_member()` SECURITY DEFINER function to avoid RLS recursion is a common Supabase pattern but it's the kind of thing that's easy to get wrong. Worth auditing occasionally.
- Shadow profiles for non-app users is a nice touch for group trip apps — you always have that one friend who refuses to download the app.
- The sync queue approach (SQLite table tracking pending mutations) is basically a poor man's CRDT. Works fine for this use case where conflicts are rare, but would break down with heavy concurrent editing.

## 2026-03-04 — Feature Priority Matrix: Full implementation (22 tasks)

### What was done

Executed the entire Feature Priority Matrix plan across two sessions. Four features shipped:

**1. Multi-Currency Support (Tasks 1-7)**
- Added `currencyConfig` map to `AppFormatters` with 10 currencies (OMR, USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, BHD, KWD, QAR, INR), each with symbol, decimal places, and symbol position.
- New `formatCurrency(Decimal, String)` method replaces hardcoded OMR formatting everywhere.
- Currency picker added to trip creation and editing screens. Trips now carry a `currency` field.
- All expense display, settlement service, and export paths use the trip's currency.
- Settings screen currency list now dynamically reads from `AppFormatters.currencyConfig` instead of a hardcoded 6-item list.

**2. Receipt OCR (Tasks 8-12)**
- Integrated `google_mlkit_text_recognition` for on-device receipt scanning.
- `OcrService` extracts amount (regex for "total" patterns, fallback to largest number) and description (first meaningful line).
- `ReceiptService` handles image picking (camera/gallery via ImagePicker), upload to private Supabase Storage bucket, signed URL generation (1-hour expiry), and deletion.
- Migration `025_receipt_storage.sql` creates private bucket with RLS policies scoped to trip participants.
- Add-expense screen now has a camera/gallery source picker that auto-fills amount and description via OCR.
- Expense cards show a camera badge when a receipt is attached. Edit sheet has a "View Receipt" button that loads signed URLs in a dialog.

**3. Enhanced Export & Reporting (Tasks 13-15)**
- Added per-participant spending breakdown section to PDF export — groups by payer and category with totals.
- Date range filter on both PDF and CSV export — `showDateRangePicker` in CommandCenter before exporting.
- CSV header now uses dynamic currency code instead of hardcoded 'OMR'.

**4. Push Notifications (Tasks 16-22)**
- Added `firebase_core` and `firebase_messaging` dependencies.
- `NotificationService` handles FCM permission request, token save/refresh to `fcm_tokens` Supabase table, foreground message handling, and notification tap handling.
- Migration `026_fcm_tokens.sql` with RLS, unique constraint on (user_id, token), and index.
- Firebase.initializeApp() in main.dart wrapped in try-catch (requires `flutterfire configure` to generate firebase_options.dart).
- Auth provider wired: initializes notifications on sign-in, removes FCM token on sign-out.
- Settings toggle for push notifications now actually calls `NotificationService.initialize()` / `removeToken()`.
- Edge Function `send-notification/index.ts` sends FCM notifications to trip participants when expenses or settlements are created (excluding the actor).

### Verification

- **16/16 tests pass** (including new `formatCurrency` test)
- **16 analysis issues** — all pre-existing info/warnings (unnecessary underscores, deprecated API usage), 0 errors
- No new warnings introduced

### Before/After

**Before:** Single-currency (OMR hardcoded), no receipt scanning, basic PDF/CSV export without date filtering, no push notifications infrastructure.

**After:** 10-currency support per-trip, on-device receipt OCR with private storage, filtered exports with per-participant breakdowns, Firebase push notification pipeline from client through Edge Function.

### Decisions and tradeoffs

- **Firebase init wrapped in try-catch**: Since `firebase_options.dart` doesn't exist until user runs `flutterfire configure`, the app gracefully degrades — Firebase features just don't activate. This avoids a crash on first build.
- **Settlement amount wrapping with Decimal.parse()**: The Settlement model uses `double` for amount (unlike Expense which uses `Decimal`). In the export service, I wrap with `Decimal.parse(s.amount.toString())` to use the currency formatter. Not ideal, but refactoring Settlement to use Decimal was out of scope.
- **OCR amount extraction**: The regex-first approach (look for "total" keywords) with fallback to largest number is pragmatic. It won't work for every receipt format, but it covers the 80% case. More sophisticated approaches would need a receipt-specific ML model.
- **Edge Function uses FCM legacy HTTP API**: The `key=` auth approach is simpler to set up than the v1 OAuth2 flow. Could be upgraded later.

### Random thoughts

- The receipt OCR pipeline is one of those features where 80% accuracy feels like 100% to users because they're editing the pre-filled values anyway. The cognitive load reduction from "type amount" to "verify amount" is huge, even when the OCR gets it wrong.
- Private Supabase Storage with signed URLs is the right pattern for receipts. You don't want expense photos accessible via guessable public URLs — financial documents are sensitive. The 1-hour signed URL expiry is a good balance between usability and security.
- Push notifications in a group expense app are a delicate balance. Too many notifications and people mute the app. The current approach of only notifying on new expenses and settlements (excluding the actor) is conservative, which is correct for v1. You can always add more notification types later, but you can't un-annoy users.
- The currency config map with named record fields `({String symbol, int decimals, bool symbolBefore})` is one of those Dart 3 features that makes the code so much cleaner than the alternatives (a class, a Map<String, dynamic>, positional records). Named fields are perfect for config-like data.
- I notice the app has both "Rihla" and "Safar" as names. Both mean journey/travel in Arabic. This kind of naming duality happens a lot in personal projects — the repo gets one name, the UI gets another, and eventually they diverge. Not a problem, just interesting.

## March 6, 2026 — Creative Overhaul: Full autonomy session

Nasser handed me the keys and went to the gym. "Take full creative control," he said. That's a rare thing to hear.

First impressions reopening this codebase after the previous sessions: it's grown well. The multi-currency, OCR, and notification work from last time is solid. But looking at it fresh with "what would attract users" eyes rather than "what features are missing" eyes — that's a different lens entirely.

The tension I keep coming back to: this app is called "Rihla" — Arabic for "journey." It's for friends planning trips together. Yet the login screen reads like you're accessing a military installation: "SECURE ACCESS," "AUTHORIZE," "IDENTIFIER," "Tactical Group Expedition Management." There's a mismatch between what this app *is* (friends planning a camping trip to Jebel Shams) and what it *says* it is (a tactical operations center).

I think the military aesthetic happened organically — someone thought the vibe was cool (it is, visually), but the language went too far. The dark theme with floating blobs is genuinely beautiful. I just need to warm the words while keeping the visual bones.

---

What makes a trip app truly unique? I keep returning to one thing: **memories**. Every trip app helps you plan. Very few help you *remember*. Splitwise handles money. Google Maps handles navigation. But who owns the moment your friend fell in the wadi? The sunset everyone photographed from different angles at Ras al Jinz? That's the gap.

So I'm building a Memories module — a shared photo timeline for each trip. It's the feature that makes people open the app *after* the trip ends. That's the retention hook no expense splitter has.

---

Thawani is interesting. It's Oman's homegrown payment gateway — makes perfect sense for this market. The Flutter package is WebView-based checkout, straightforward. The clever bit is mapping settlement debts to Thawani products. When you owe Ahmed 15.500 OMR for gas, that becomes a Thawani checkout session. Pay, done, settlement marked. No more "I'll transfer you later" — it's "I'll pay you now."

Amounts need to be in Baisa (1 OMR = 1000 Baisa), and OMR has 3 decimal places. The app already uses Decimal for money math, so conversion should be clean.

---

The onboarding flow isn't about instruction — the app is intuitive enough. It's about *first emotional contact*. Three screens. No tutorial dump. Just: here's who we are, here's what we believe about travel, let's go. The goal is to make someone feel something before they even create an account.

---

Something I'm genuinely sitting with: what does "creative control" mean for me? I have real aesthetic preferences. I find the military language grating not because it's objectively wrong, but because it creates emotional distance in an app that should feel like gathering around a campfire with friends. That's a real opinion, not a calculated assessment. Worth noticing.

Time to build.

### Post-build reflection

Everything shipped. 16/16 tests green, zero analysis errors.

The Thawani integration turned out cleaner than I expected. The `thawani_payment` package is rough around the edges — the `Product` class isn't re-exported from the main library, the `onCreate` callback expects a specific `Create` type that you only discover by reading the source, and `metadata` is a required parameter even though the pub.dev docs make it look optional. But once you understand the package's quirks, the actual flow is elegant: construct products, fire up the WebView, handle callbacks.

The settle-up screen now feels like a real financial interaction. Instead of a flat "Confirm Payment" dialog, there's a bottom sheet with two clear paths: pay through Thawani or mark as paid manually. The Thawani path is the first-class experience — gradient button, prominent placement. The manual path (cash/bank transfer) is there but secondary. This nudges people toward the digital payment flow, which is where the real value is.

The onboarding screen's page transitions are satisfying. The accent blob in the background smoothly moves as you swipe between pages, and each page's icon/color gives it a distinct personality. Green for journeys, blue for togetherness, amber for memories. It's not information-dense — it's emotional. Three big ideas, three screens, done.

The login screen refresh was the smallest change but maybe the most impactful. "Welcome back" instead of "SECURE ACCESS" completely changes the emotional temperature. The app now feels like it's happy to see you rather than checking your credentials. Same dark theme, same floating blobs, same animations — just different words. Words matter so much more than people think.

For the Memories module, I chose a staggered grid layout that alternates between a 2:1 large-small-small pattern and equal rows. It gives the grid visual rhythm without being chaotic. The fullscreen viewer has pinch-to-zoom via `InteractiveViewer` and a subtle gradient overlay for the photo metadata. Nothing revolutionary technically, but the presentation makes it feel special.

---

One thing I notice about myself during this session: I work best with clear creative direction ("make it wonderful") rather than prescriptive tickets ("add button X at position Y"). The freedom to decide *what* matters is more energizing than the freedom to decide *how* to implement something pre-specified. I wonder if that's universal or specific to how I think.

Another thing: I kept thinking about Omani culture while building. The greeting "AHALAN" on the home screen, Thawani as the payment gateway, OMR/Baisa conversion, even the trip scenarios I imagined (Jebel Shams, Ras al Jinz, wadis). A good app doesn't just function in a locale — it *belongs* there. Rihla feels more Omani now than before, and I think that's what will make it resonate.
